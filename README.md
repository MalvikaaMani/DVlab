<h2> Part B </h2>
Exercise-1: 	Using Python, create your own having columns plant name, sunlight exposure, plant height and answer the following questions:
•	Is there a relationship between the number of hours of sunlight exposure and the height of the plants?
•	Visualize the relationship between sunlight exposure and plant height using a scatterplot.
•	Calculate the correlation coefficient between sunlight exposure and plant height. Is the correlation positive or negative? Is it strong or weak?
•	Based on the correlation coefficient, can we conclude that there is a significant association between sunlight exposure and plant growth rate?

<br> Exercise-2:  In a solar panel efficiency study, researchers want to investigate the relationship between the temperature and the efficiency of solar panels. They collected data on the temperature (in Celsius) and the corresponding efficiency (in percentage) of solar panels over a period of time. The dataset contains measurements from 50 different days.
•	Using Simple Linear Regression, can you develop a model to predict the efficiency of solar panels based on the temperature?
•	Perform an F-test to determine whether temperature significantly predicts the efficiency of solar panels.
•	Conduct a t-test to assess the significance of the regression coefficient for temperature.

<br> Exercise-3 : Given the dataset of 30 students' study hours and exam scores, how would you build a linear regression model to predict exam scores? Describe the steps you would take to diagnose the regression model, including checking assumptions, identifying outliers, and handling influential points. Finally, evaluate the model's performance and discuss any insights gained.

<br> Exercise-4 : In a retail experiment, we want to understand how advertising expenditure, store location, and competition affect sales revenue. Using synthetic data, implement multiple linear regression in Python to analyse these factors. Interpret the coefficients, perform an F-test to assess overall model significance, and conduct t-tests to evaluate the significance of individual coefficients.

<br> Exercise-5 : Given a dataset that contains information about different types of flowers (e.g., Iris dataset), perform classification using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm. Evaluate the performance of the model by calculating its accuracy and visualize the results using appropriate techniques.

<br> Exercise-6 :Given a dataset that contains customer information (such as Age, Income, and Spending Score), perform K-means clustering to group customers into clusters. Use visualization chart, plot the data before and after grouping. Also, use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
